### ⚠️ About 

Shades Tweaker is an advanced tool containing many customization options. It allows you to make various improvements and customizations on your Windows 10 and Windows 11-installed devices. I strongly recommend using this application on your low-quality desktop computer, as it will provide an extra FPS boost. It is very secure, fast, and up-to-date.

### 🛑 Prerequisites
